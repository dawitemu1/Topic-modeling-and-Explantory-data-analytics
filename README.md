# Topic modelling 
Topic modeling is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to identify topics present in a text corpus. It helps uncover the hidden thematic structure in a large collection of documents. One of the popular algorithms for topic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), though other methods such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are also used.
# Explantory data analytics 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial phase in the data analysis process where the main goal is to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, often with the help of visualizations and statistical summaries. EDA helps analysts and data scientists understand the data, identify patterns, relationships, anomalies, and formulate hypotheses that can guide further analysis or model building. Here are key aspects and techniques of exploratory data analysis:

    Descriptive Statistics:
        Summary Statistics: Compute measures like mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and variance to describe the central tendency and variability of the data.
        Percentiles and Quartiles: Understand the distribution of values by looking at percentiles and quartiles.

    Data Visualization:
        Histograms: Visualize the distribution of a single variable.
        Box Plots: Show the distribution of a dataset and identify outliers.
        Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between two variables.
        Heatmaps: Display the correlation between variables.
        Pair Plots: Visualize relationships between multiple variables in a grid.

    Data Cleaning:
        Handling Missing Values: Identify and decide how to deal with missing data.
        Outlier Detection: Identify and address outliers that may distort analysis.

    Feature Engineering:
        Creation of Derived Features: Develop new features based on existing ones to enhance analysis.
        Binning and Categorization: Group continuous variables into bins or create categorical variables.

    Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:
        Univariate Analysis: Understand the distribution of individual variables.
        Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables.

    Correlation Analysis:
        Correlation Coefficients: Calculate correlation coefficients to measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
        Correlation Matrix: Visualize correlations among multiple variables.

    Data Transformation:
        Normalization and Standardization: Scale numerical features for consistency.
        Logarithmic Transformation: Address skewed distributions.

    Pattern Recognition:
        Trends and Seasonality: Identify trends and patterns over time.
        Cluster Analysis: Group similar data points together.
